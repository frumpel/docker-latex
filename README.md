# docker-latex

Minimal [texlive](https://tug.org/texlive/) docker image based on the work of [Benedik Lang](https://github.com/blang) on [latex docker](https://github.com/blang/latex-docker). This replaces the debian xenial base image with alpine linux.

My primary use case is PDF creation from latex templates but as per documentation at the original site there is a lot more one could do with this.
