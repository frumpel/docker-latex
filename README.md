# docker-latex

Minimal [https://tug.org/texlive/](texlive) docker image based on the work of [https://github.com/blang](Benedik Lang) on [https://github.com/blang/latex-docker](latex docker). This replaces the debian xenial base image with alpine linux.

My primary use case is PDF creation from latex templates but as per documentation at the original site there is a lot more one could do with this.
